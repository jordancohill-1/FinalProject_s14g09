# FinalProject_s14g09

**Our Project:** 
VIS IMDB

**Team Members:**
- Jordan Cohill
- Phillip Tran
- Samer Maaliki

**Project Background:**
The project will use movie poster images from an IMDB database and based on an image analysis of color (and maybe some face and text recognition), it will predict if a movie will be a success or a "rotten tomato".  

The final outcome will be a webpage that explains to the end user the ML process that was used to make the prediction.  If time allows, the team will look into a separate page where users can upload their potential posters and get a recommendation on how the film will do and what can be done with the poster's colors(and/or other features) in order to increase the movie's appeal and success.

**Project Plan**

- Jul 5 - Jul 14: Acquire the data and investigate methods for analyzing color, text and facial features and determine which route(s) to take. 
- Jul 15 - Jul 25: Train the algorithm to analyze the posters and to determine the features that would make the movie a success. 
- Jul 20 - Jul 30: Start working on explaining the algorithm to the end user in the front end.
- Jul 25 - Aug 5: Finalize the algorithms and the front-end. If time allows, design and develop a fron-end page for users to upload their posters to be analyzed by the algorithm and get recommendations
